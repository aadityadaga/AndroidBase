# AndroidBase
Android Base App to start your project with Kotlin, MVP, Data binding, ROOM database, Live Data, Retrofit API caching(works offline)

If you are going to start a new Android project then this project can be pretty nice thing to start with as it is 
already configured with a lot of boilerplate code like
1. MVP-i architecture.
2. Room db layer implementation.
3. Live data use.
4. Retrofit with offline mode i.e. Network caching - If there is no internet/slow internet then the Api will provide you last saved(saved automatically)
   response until the API call gives you the latest response and then again will save it for next api call.
